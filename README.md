# 1MED AI (One Malaysia Medical AI)

> One Malaysia, one medical AI — watching over every order.
>
> Closed-loop order dispatch for paper wards. A doctor speaks — or types — one
> order, in any mix of Malaysia's four languages. It is safety-checked,
> dispatched to the nurse in under two seconds, signed at the bedside,
> escalated when missed, and permanently logged. No EMR required.
>
> Not an ambient scribe: we do not record the consultation. Formerly
> "MedNexus Scribe" / "MEDJ AI".

MVP wedge for the **MAIC Nexus Challenge 2026** (Track T2 — AI for Healthcare).

## Ports

| Port | Route | Device |
|---|---|---|
| Doctor (主治醫生) | `/doctor` | iPad / mobile |
| Nurse (護士) | `/nurse` | mobile |
| Head Nurse Control Tower (護士長) | `/control-tower` | desktop (read-only) |

The landing page (`/`) is a demo role-picker that sets a `role` cookie and
routes into each port (real auth is out of MVP scope).

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js 14** (App Router) + TypeScript
- **Tailwind CSS 3** + shadcn/ui (Radix)
- **Supabase** — Postgres + Auth + Realtime + Storage
- **Google Gemini 3 Flash** (native audio) for speech-to-text — handles English/Malay/Mandarin mixed *within a single sentence*, which Whisper cannot: it locks one language per clip. See `src/lib/ai/stt.ts`.
- **Google Gemini 3 Flash** for structured clinical extraction
- Deployed on **Vercel** + **Supabase Cloud**

## Local Development

pnpm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # fill in Supabase + Gemini keys

```
